Put good messages in your commit - noel i using them to see how things are going

Style -> use camel case

how many objects in a given file in scala:
- good practice to do one object per file
- object/file names should start with upper case
- package files are lower case

scala has the concept of the component object

lexical scoping - changes availability of names, program text determines what is available

shadowing - using the same variable name in different elements of scope,

val - cannot change value
var - can then go reassign, typically don't use var, breaks substitution

why do people like substitution
- reasona bout system in isolation, nothing can change the meaning/framing of the program

local reasoning - think about just the code youre looking at, without understanding the whole system

Abstraction - taking different things and making them the same (making details irrelevent)
naming is one form of abstraction, its a way of abtracting over an expression

substitution

what is the substitution model of evaluation?
represent a evaluation by a name or a value, whenever there is a name, substitute the value
replace an expression with its value or replace an expression with the value it evaluates to
evaluate the complicated expression, break it into sub expressions, substitute the result in

how does substitution proceed (in what order in scala)?

top -> bottom (evaluates scope from top to bottom)
left to right

effects - anything that has an observable change to the world in some way that will break substitution (ex. println, draw)
- anything that has state
