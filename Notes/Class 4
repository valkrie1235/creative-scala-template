what are values, objects, functions, etc

expressions evaluate to values

values are things that live in the computers memory, that hav emeaning: locations in the computers memory, things that you can process
1+2 evaulates to 3
1.+(2) (its actually a mthod of one that is adding a value)


first class values
- when you can pass it to a method, return it from a method, or give it a name with a 'val'
- can't pass a method too a method, can't return a method to a method, methods are NOT first class
- allows us to more clearly define hierarchical set of fucntions- absttraction
- composition

functions return as functions, in the rose function, set it once will return a function


method allows us to pull parts of an expression

why cant we just use methods as functions?
- historical baggage
- performance implications for making everything a method

what if ints were not first class

What is an object?
- in scalal all values are objects
an object is somethign with methods (and fields, but scala hides the differnce)

what is a method?
- reusable generalization of expressions

what is a function?
- a first class method
an object with a method called 'apply' and also inhereting from one of the function types


underscore syntax

currying is a function of multiple arguments to one of single arguments (foo2_).curried
